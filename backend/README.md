# Dating app blok tech 19-20

In this semester the assignment is to build a dating application in NodeJs. The assignment is to make a jobstory and solve it with your application.  
my job story is:  


> I want to be able to engage in conversation, potentially leading to a date/dates with my matches. I want to be able to disengage as well.

## To Run
to run my application on your local machine you'll need to do the following:  
* clone this repo  
* you'll need access to the database which only i can give at this point (so maybe email me?)
* when you have the access keys to the database you will need to place them in the [.env] file.
* navigate to the [backend] file and run "npm install"
* next run [npm run dev]
* in your browser you can now visit [localhost:3000], where the app should be running

## the Application
The chat is currently built to simulate how it woud work in a fully functioning app, to do this I feigned the steps which would happen prior to making chatting possible. The steps I feigned are matching and logging in.  

In the app you will see a list of chats you can interact with and send messages in, in my chat feature you are logged in as Janno and are can tlk to the girls you/Janno has matched with. To simulate a responce there is a semi-hidden chat to feign the situation where youare logged in as a fictive user "Charlie", Charlie has a match with Janno and this way you can send responses back.  
I think it's nicer to actually use it than read about it so please do run the project.
